//Annotation Interface for Text and Audio

//Audio Annotation Interface
    Assumptions:
        1. Single Audio File can have multiple labels to be tagged
        2. Admin decides the labels to be tagged
    Doubts:
        1. Admin decides which sections of the audio to be tagged
            E.g - SampleAudio - 0:00 - 5:00
                Admin has decided labels - isBot, isHuman, isQuestion, isAnswer
                Also Admin has decided:-
                    0:10-0:20
                    1:20-1:25
                    2:10-2:16
                As data points to be tagged in this SampleAudio

            OR  
        1. Users can tag audio from any section of the audio
            E.g - SampleAudio - 0:00 - 5:00
                Admin has decided the labels - isBot, isHuman, isQuestion, isAnswer
                Admin has assigned this audio data to a user
                User sees the whole audio in the interface
                and chooses sub sections of the audio and tags them with provided labels


        2. Data (or DataPoint) vs Dataset - Is a single audio file (uploaded by admin) equivalent to a dataset?
            and sections to be tagged in that audio file corresponds to a data point?
